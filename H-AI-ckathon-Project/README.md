All processes and problems faced to be documented in this read me file

We will have to plan accordingly in such a way that we have time to write into this readme file

The .gitignore file contains all the names of files and folders which aren't to be displayed to public

The following is the plan:

3rd January:

8pm - 8:30pm : Selecting the problem statement

8:30pm - 9pm : Understanding the problem statement, determining the model to use, and the technical stack to use

9pm - 12am: Division of tasks and reading the necessary documentation for our project 
(along with breaks if any, can also start development of backend(better to))

4th January

12am - 3am: Model and backend development, People assigned to frontend can take time in reading documentation and play around.

3am - 4am: break*

4am - 6am: Start building the frontend, backend development can continue if not finished

6am : End of backend

6am - 7am: Frontend development (Integrate with backend and correct backend and frontend along the way)

7am - 9am: Breakfast* (8am Halfway mark)

9am - 12am: Frontend development (Integrate with backend and correct backend and frontend along the way)

12pm: End of primary development (Our application should be able to solve the main problem statement)

12pm - 3pm: Testing, thinking about edge cases and tuning the model and code accordingly

3pm - 5pm: Debugging corrections and testing one last time

5pm - 6pm: Documenting the usage of this project in this readme file

6pm - 8pm: Break and Dinner

8pm: End of Hackathon

Total work hours: ~20hrs

Break hours: ~4hrs

Note: Take shorter breaks during working hours, 15 mins at max (to keep our sanity). If you want to keep working during the
breaks as well that is upto you but we better use the breaks

Keep calm and stay focus we can win this. Prepare well. All the best to us!!!
